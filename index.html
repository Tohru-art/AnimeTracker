            <p>Hello, everyone! I'm Will, an 18-year-old with a burning passion for coding, especially in the realm of
                web development. This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to be a part of All Star Code, an
                experience that has truly transformed my coding journey. As an All Star Code student, I've been diving
                headfirst into the world of coding, learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while
                creating dynamic and visually stunning websites. I've honed my skills through various projects and
                coding challenges, earning recognition for my dedication and innovative thinking. Beyond just the
                technical skills, this journey has been about personal growth - expanding my horizons, fostering
                creativity, and developing critical problem-solving abilities.</p>
